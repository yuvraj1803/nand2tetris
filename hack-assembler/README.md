The Hack Assembler converts Assembly code to the Hack Machine code.

Components of the assembler: Parser + Translator + Symbol Table

How to run?
The executable file is present in the cmake-build-debug/ directory. After navigating to it, type "./hack-assembler <file-name>".
  Eg: ./hack-assembler add/Add.asm
  
  This creates a .hack file in the same location of your assembly file.
